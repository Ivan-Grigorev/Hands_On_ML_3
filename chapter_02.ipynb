    "In this chapter, an example project will be worked through from end to end, with the perspective of being a newly hired data scientist at a real estate company. Although this example is fictitious, the main steps of a machine learning project will be illustrated, rather than focusing on learning about the real estate business. The following steps will be covered:\n",
    "- The big picture will be examined.\n",
    "- The data will be obtained.\n",
    "- The data will be explored and visualized to gain insights.\n",
    "- The data will be prepared for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "- A model will be selected and trained.\n",
    "- The model will be fine-tuned.\n",
    "- The solution will be presented.\n",
    "- The system will be launched, monitored, and maintained."
